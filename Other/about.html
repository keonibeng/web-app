                <p>
                    This application came up with the idea when last year, I was not feeling well and lying in the bed
                    for the whole day, my mom sometimes forgets to buy some of my medicine. I fully understand her
                    situation because, she has a lot of things to do in our house. I told her “I wish there is a service
                    like, if we forgot something to buy, we can just ask for it and there is someone who will buy for
                    us.” and she just smile and agree from my speech. With that, our Requesting A Purchasing Favor
                    System invented.
